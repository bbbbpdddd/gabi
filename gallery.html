                  <p>Warm, sensuous perfumes infused with exotic spices.
                    Spicy perfumes and fragrances are perfume scents that have spice in the composition are made from anything that you would find in a spice rack in the kitchen like cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, pepper cloves and nutmeg are combined with oriental materials, such as woods and resins to form a base of notes very distinct and pleasant to the senses.
                    If you do not know which spicy perfume to buy, the staff at JIJI&GABI have come up with our list of the best spicy perfumes to buy for women that we think combine the best complex cocktail of spices and floral notes to create savory notes classified as spicy perfume.</p>

                  <h2>Woody</h2><br>
                  <p>The clue, quite simply, is in the name – although some of these fragrances do smell like they’re closely related to the chyprefamily. It’s true:  they share some characteristics, but generally without the floral flourishes of the chypres.
                  Perfumers have a fabulous palette of woody elements to weave into their creations: sandalwood, cedar, agarwood (a.k.a. oud), guiaiacwood, as well as patchouli and vetiver. (These last two aren’t woods: they’re roots and leaves, respectively – but you’d never guess, from their intensely earthy, woody character.)
                  Woody fragrances can be given a spin by adding spices/fruity notes, or herbs – so if you like woods (or you’re simply interested in learning what they smell like), do explore the other members of this family, too… Many masculine, quite a few shared and a few women’s fragrances belong to the woody family.</p>

                  <h2>Oriental</h2><br>
                  <p>Oriental fragrances have been a popular choice for evening wear and the winter months, thanks to their warming and long-lasting scents. Oriental fragrances for men and women are often inspired by the first fragrance creations in places like India and ancient Arabia.
                  No fragrance collection is complete without an oriental fragrance; it can smell and feel a little more grown-up than other scent families, with a rich and sensual combination of notes. 
                  Over the years, oriental fragrances have evolved into many different forms, with so many perfumes and aftershaves to choose from. Warm, sweet and even a little spicy, oriental fragrances are a stunning choice for after-dark.</p>

                  <h2>Powdery</h2><br>
                  <p>Powder is not an ingredient but a feeling that can often be found in perfumes. Powdery scents often have something dry, soft and enveloping. Consider the smell (and feel!) of facial, baby, or talcum powder. Typical powdery perfumes leave the wearer feeling clean and cared for. But powdery can take different turns too, such as make-up, boudoir, the creamy sensuality of vanilla, or the slightly dirty notes of musk.</p>
